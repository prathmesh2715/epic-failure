## Problem Statement
**Theme:** Quantum Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection

**Description:**
Financial transactions generate massive and complex datasets where unusual patterns or anomalies, such as fraudulent activities or errors, can easily remain hidden. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with these datasets due to their size and complexity, leading to slower processing times and less accurate results. 

**Objective:**
You are tasked with building a quantum machine learning model to detect anomalies in financial transactions using the "Credit Card Transaction Anomalies" dataset from Kaggle. This project will explore quantum algorithms and tools like Qiskit and PennyLane to develop an innovative approach, aiming to design a quantum model that demonstrates improvements in speed, scalability, and accuracy compared to classical methods.

### Expected Solution:
- Development of a quantum-based model for anomaly detection in financial datasets.
- Comparative analysis showcasing improvements in speed, scalability, and accuracy.
- Demonstration of how quantum computing techniques outperform classical models in the context of financial anomaly detection.
- Submission of Jupyter Notebook or Python code.

## Dataset
- **Dataset:** [Credit Card Transaction Anomalies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle.
- Participants are encouraged to explore and incorporate more complex datasets to demonstrate the potential quantum advantage.

## Instructions on Running Your Project
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathmesh2715/epic-failure.git
   cd https://github.com/prathmesh2715/epic-failure.git
2. Set Up the Environment:

It is recommended to create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
